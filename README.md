## Introduction

### What is captcha?

Captcha is a type of challengeâ€“response test used in computing to determine whether the user is human.

For example reCAPTCHA v2 is task to select images that match description.

### What is captcha harvester?

Captcha harvester is a tool to solve captchas yourself, store them, and evantually use when you need them in your automation software / bot.

### What is use case of captcha harvester

Bot to buy limited products. When your bot is at checkout, you don't have to solve captcha, you can solve it before and inject solved captcha when it's needed. It gives you advanatge of extra couple seconds.

### How does captcha harvester work?

- Sitekey

    First we need to know what is a sitekey. Sitekey is a string that is linked to website and is identifying it regarding captcha. Sitekey is needed to render captcha box. Note that if you will try to render captcha on website with sitekey that is not matching website it will fail. So we need two things: website url and website sitekey. Sitekey can be found in element with "g-recaptcha" class in "data-sitekey" tag or can be found in javascript like: 'sitekey' : 'some_siyekey'.
    
- Captcha response

    Next we need to undesrstand what determines if captcha is solved. When captcha is solved inside element with id "g-recaptcha-response" will be long string: it is called captcha response. Now we can copy that string, and when we need to submit some form where captcha is needed to be solved, we can inject inside same element captcha response and submit form.

- Harvester

    Harvester is instance of automated browser window. Harvester opens website you want to harvest captchas on. HTML is changed to blank HTML document with just captcha box in it. Captcha is rendered and you can solve captchas. When you solve captcha, captcha response is stored in response queue and captcha box is reseted so you can solve more captchas. When captcha response is needed in your automation software / bot it can be pulled from response queue and used.

- HarvesterManager

    There is a HarvesterManager class that is managing all Harvesters, when main_loop is called, HarvesterManager is executing tick function in all Harvesters in infinite loop, all responses from queues in Harvesters are moved to single queue in HarvesterManager. Note that there is expiration time for every captcha solved. For reCAPTCHA v2 expiration time is 120 seconds counted from moment of successful captcha solve.

## Features

Captcha Harvester supports logging in to your Google account to lower captcha difficulty.

Harvester can run with additional window where Youtube videos will be viewed to make activity on your Google account to lower captcha difficulty. 

Sitekey can be scraped from website on which you want to harvsest captchas by executing get_sitekey method from Harvester class. 


## Compatibility

Captcha harvester was tested and working on Windows and Linux.

For now harvester is compatible with reCAPTCHA v2. In the future it will be compatible with reCAPTCHA v3, hCaptcha and others.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- All packages from requirements.txt
- Google Chrome

## Installation

- Download and install Python 3 from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.
- Install all packages from requirements.txt. In terminal type: `pip install -r requirements.txt` ( You need to be in same directory as requirements.txt or provide full path to requirements.txt. )
- Install Google Chrome from <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">here</a>.

## How to use

- Example code

    - In example.py is shown an example of a simple way to use harvester.
    
        ```
        # Simple example of using captcha harvester with one Harvester and printing captcha responses to console.


        def main():
            url = 'https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo'
            # Scraping sitekey from url
            sitekey = Harvester.get_sitekey(url)

            # Creating HarvesterManager object with additional argument response_callback which is function,
            # that will be called everytime HarvesterManager pull captcha response from Harvseter ( after user solve captcha )
            harvester_manager = HarvesterManger(response_callback=lambda x: print(x['response']))
            # Adding Harvester object to HarvesterManager object with url and sitekey as arguments
            harvester_manager.add_harvester(Harvester(url, sitekey))
            # Launching all harvesters
            harvester_manager.start_harvesters()
            # Starting main_loop inside HarvesterManager object, that will manage all Harvesters
            harvester_manager.main_loop()


        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()
        ```
    
    - In example_bot.py is shown an example of connecting harvester with bot and sending solved captchas to it.
    
        ```
        # Example of using captcha harvester with example Bot class that is receiving captcha responses and using them to submit form.
        # NOTE. This example uses 2 Harvester objects, 1 of them uses logging in to Google account and launching extra window with Youtube.


        def main():
            url = 'https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo'
            # Scraping sitekey from url
            sitekey = Harvester.get_sitekey(url)

            # Creating HarvesterManager object
            harvester_manager = HarvesterManger()
            # Adding Harvester object to HarvesterManager object with url and sitekey as arguments
            harvester_manager.add_harvester(Harvester(url=url, sitekey=sitekey))
            # Adding Harvester object to HarvesterManager object with additional arguments to login to Google account and open window with Youtube.
            harvester_manager.add_harvester(Harvester(url=url, sitekey=sitekey, log_in=True, open_youtube=True))
            # Launching all harvesters
            harvester_manager.start_harvesters()
            # Creating Bot object with HarvesterManager as argument so it can reach its response_queue
            bot = Bot(harvester_manager)
            # Launching Bot 
            bot.start(url=url)
            # Creating bot and harvester_manager main_loop threads
            bot_loop_thread = Thread(target=bot.main_loop)
            harvester_manager_loop_thread = Thread(target=harvester_manager.main_loop)
            # Starting threads
            bot_loop_thread.start()
            harvester_manager_loop_thread.start()
            # Joining threads
            bot_loop_thread.join()
            harvester_manager_loop_thread.join()


        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()
        ```
    
    To run example code just run example.py or example_bot.py with python.
